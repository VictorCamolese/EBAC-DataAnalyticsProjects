# Brazil Demografic Data Wrangling
Here's my favorite Data Wrangling project by far! \
We acces the two files `cidades-bruto.csv` and `estados-bruto.csv`, clean and filter them up, \
and create new files cleaned and better formated to take demografic informations about all cities and countries from brazil \
After all this, we create the `brasil.csv` a complete DataFrame with all these informations in just one .csv file \
\
Feel free to use and reuse these files and study them, I'm already happy that you're here seeing this. \
